# incremental_game

Thinking part:

First I thought about the layout for almost an all day, because I wanted to make something visual pretty.
After the layout I thought about witch theme I would use.

HTML & CSS:

After that I tried to make everything work with html and css.
Using flexbox was a real challenge because it was the first time I used it...And I still have to learn more about it.
So I really struggled with the layout but puzzling it down and looking a lot up on the internet I managed to finish somehow my layout.

JS:

Then I started to work on my js. I did some looking up on Google/Youtube just to understand how you can code an incremental game and how I can manage to implement it to my game.
I first started simple with how to link the clicking and a counter to my html.
After that I made a reset button. With the reset button I had some issues because I didn't manage to reset all the counters and planets but @ the end I got it fixed.
Then I started to work on my multipliers. It wasn't easy but after understanding the first function to buy a planet then it went a little smoother.
After that I implemented a set interval that would do 1+ seconds to the total amount of clicks.

In my code I have written comments to understand better what I did if I ever need to go back for some research.
